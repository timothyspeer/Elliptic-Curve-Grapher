# Elliptic Curve Grapher
This program allows for the graphing of a curve defined by a Weierstrass equation of the form *y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> + ax + b*. 

The parameters *a* and *b* can take values in the interval *[-100, 100]*. The program will graph both singular and nonsingular curves 
depending on the values of *a* and *b* entered by the user.

The curve will be graphed over the interval *[-x range, x range]* where *x range* is a parameter entered by the user. The parameter 
*x range* can take values in the interval *[1, 500]*.
